This python module (blah blah)

reate code using python pandas to organize and reduce climate data. You will gain experience using an API call to a data server at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to produce a visualization of so-called climate stripes, created by Ed Hawkins at the University of Reading. Our version of climate stripes will optionally add a quantitative plot over top of the plot so you can plot with axis labels to see the values of temperature and time corresponding to the plot. This new version will add axes and a line graph showing the time and value axes on the x- and y-axes, respectively.

Task: Create code using python pandas to organize and reduce climate data. 
The code must be called with a GHCN site id, a date range, a flag whether to plot the data over the stripes, and a time period to average over for each stripe (i.e. annual, monthly, weekly, etc.). The code should download the data automatically from NCEI using the API version 2 and use pandas for the data reduction, and matplotlib to plot the visualization. 

The appropriate references for the data, including DOI numbers, for the datasets used. Also, appropriate references to the Climate Stripes creator/technique should be included.

Note: The NCEI is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and, as you can see from the URL for the API, this resource was created when the NCEI was called the NCDC. Should the URL for this resource change in the future, you can search for the NCEI weather API to find the updated one.
