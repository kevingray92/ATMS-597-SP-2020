# ATMS 597 Project 2-Group G

Group members: Kevin Gray, Rose Miller, Rylan Housenga

This python module (blah blah)

Task: Create code using python pandas to organize and reduce climate data. 
The code must be called with a GHCN site id, a date range, a flag whether to plot the data over the stripes, and a time period to average over for each stripe (i.e. annual, monthly, weekly, etc.). The code should download the data automatically from NCEI using the API version 2 and use pandas for the data reduction, and matplotlib to plot the visualization.
