# ATMS 597 Project 2-Group G

Group members: Kevin Gray, Rose Miller, Rylan Housenga

This python module organizes and reduces climate data using an API to call to a data server at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) to produce a visualization of  climate stripes, created by Ed Hawkins at the University of Reading. The following code adds a quantitative plot over the climate stripe product for a more quantitive approach to the climate stripes figure. This code specifically uses the GHCH site from Rantoul, IL for 1949-2020 but can easily be changed to any GHCN site and date range. This code currently allows averaging of temperatures for monthly and yearly datasets.
